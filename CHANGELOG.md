**Generic deployment notes and a systemd unit example (branch `claude/project-thread-iw7199`)**
A Docker image was dropped from the plan because apps are not deployed that way. These files are deliberately free of machine-specific details.

- `deploy/app.service`: **new**. Example systemd user unit running `uv run --locked --no-dev app serve`.
- `docs/deploying.md`: **new**. Build, install, run, reverse-proxy and how to keep a service file in step with the repo.
- `AGENTS.md`: points to them; the stale `setup_env` mention is gone (corrects the earlier line left behind by the uv change).

**Move the Python side to uv, typed strict, one gate (branch `claude/project-thread-iw7199`)**
Asked for an evaluation of this template against current best practice; the tooling gaps it found are closed here. Behaviour of the app is unchanged.

- `pyproject.toml`: now a real project (`[project]`, hatchling build, `app` console script, `[dependency-groups] dev`), with `--strict-markers --strict-config` for pytest, ruff rules `E,F,I,B,UP,SIM,RUF,C4,PT,S` at line length 120, and pyright strict.
- `uv.lock`, `.python-version`: **new**. Builds are reproducible; CI installs with `uv sync --locked`.
- `requirements.txt`, `requirements-test.txt`, `scripts/setup_env.sh`, `scripts/setup_env.ps1`: **removed**; `uv sync` replaces them. `app` and `app.cmd` stay as thin wrappers over `uv run app`.
- `scripts/check`, `scripts/check.py`: **new**. The one gate (lockfile, ruff lint and format, pyright, ty, unit tests with coverage) for git hooks, agents and CI.
- `src/app/`: fully annotated; `__version__` now reads the package metadata. `oslib.py` relaxes pyright for that one file because its Windows branches use APIs the Linux stubs lack. Formatting is `ruff format` (separate commit, no behaviour change).
- `tests/`: new `test_version.py` and a partial-settings test (coverage is 100% again); a few asserts split for ruff's PT018.
- `.github/workflows/unit.yml`, `integration.yml`: uv with cache; lint, format and types run once on Linux 3.13; weekly `uv audit`. `.github/dependabot.yml`: **new** (uv, npm, actions).
- README, AGENTS.md, test READMEs, docs: commands updated to uv and `scripts/check`.
- Not done yet: Dockerfile and systemd unit, copier conversion, release workflow (next phases).
